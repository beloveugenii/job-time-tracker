# About

The **Job time tracker** is a simple program that allows you to keep track of the time worked and the salary received for it.  

First of all, it is worth saying that this program was planned as a mobile application launched through [Termux]( https://github.com/termux ).  

In addition, for ease of use, you can use [Termux-widget](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget).  

The main reasons for the appearance of this program, apart from practical personal use, is the practice in Bash, Perl and Python, and the first experience of interacting with git and SQlite.

If someone ever finds this program and uses it, bug reports can be sent to beloveugenii@gmail.com.  

## History of project  

This is the third version of the application. The first version was written as a Bash script using awk and sed, and had little functionality. 

The second version was written in Perl and had all the necessary properties, like adding, editing and removing data. The user interface was available in Russian and English versions. You can find Perl version in "old.tar.gz" file. 

This version is rewritten in Python. It uses SQLite to store data, and translation is easy to do by editing the "strings.json" file.

## Usage

Clone it. Make 'jtt' file executable by 'chmod +x jtt'. Start it and press 'h' for help information.
